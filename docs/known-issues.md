# Known issues and open questions

Found in a code review in November 2026 and not fixed yet, or only answerable in the game. Each says what it affects, so it can be weighed against other work.

## Service

- **The worker API isn't versioned.** A newer worker copes with an older web app (it drops build stages from its heartbeats when refused), but deploy both from the same commit.

## Only the game can answer

These need the in-game harness on a machine with Assetto Corsa (`docs/dev-handover.md`):

- what `map.ini`'s `SCALE_FACTOR` means to the game's track map
- what the AI line's `direction` field does
- whether the AI drives the generated `fast_lane.ai` sensibly through hairpins (Grasstree Hill has none)
- in the Tree FX model files: the meaning of the trailer's `4`, and whether `size` scales exactly as assumed (model height × size)
- CSP rewrites each tree `.bin` the first time it loads it: the same entries, re-packed in another order and about 9 KB larger. Harmless so far, but it suggests our zip differs from the layout CSP's own writer uses.
- what race.ini's `[AUTOSPAWN]` does
- whether AI cars now stop in the run-off after the finish (250 m of road, the AI slowed to half pace by `ai_hints.ini`, and invisible walls across both ends of the road), or still turn round

Answered at milestone M3 (Grasstree Hill, both layouts; CSP 0.2.11, Content Manager's default starter):

- **Rendering:** triangle winding and the front-face convention are right. The road, terrain, verges, guard rails, houses and water all draw correctly.
- **Spawn:** the car spawns on the road with all four wheels loaded, facing along it.
- **Tree FX:** the models load, and trees stand on the ground with surface alignment on. A comment line in `trees.txt` made CSP load none (fixed: the list has no comments now).
- **Frame rate:** at about 2,500 trees per km, Tree FX costs about 60% of the frame rate on a GTX 1660 Ti at 1440p, mostly from the trees near the road. The density is still to be decided.
- **AI:** AC's AI drove the forward layout from the spawn to the finish. It ignores the 130 km/h cap in the line's speed data. The line ends 50 m past the finish gate, and the AI turns round there and leaves the road.
- **Timing:** the A→B timer starts and stops at the gates. `race_out.json` records the run as a lap with its time. Laps the AI drove for the player are recorded as time −1 with a cut.
- **Harness:** the probe app loads with its manifest, `ac.worldCoordinateToTrack` and `sim.isInMainMenu` work, and the CSP log is `custom_shaders_patch.log`.
